# TreeStore

## TASK

* There is an array of objects that have id and parent fields, through which they can be linked into a tree and some arbitrary fields.
* Requirements: maximum speed, hence minimum number of array traversals during operations. Ideally, direct access to elements without searching for them in the array.
